    I am a Computer Science student at IIIT- Kottayam, who enjoys the process of solving problems through code. For me, programming isn't just a skill, it's how I think.<br/> I love diving into complex challenges, breaking them down logically and crafting solutions that actually make sense in the real world.
    <br />
    I care about writing clean, reliable code and understanding how things work under the hood. I'm not chasing titles, Iâ€™m focused on growth, mastery, and doing meaningful work that reflects how much I love what I do.
